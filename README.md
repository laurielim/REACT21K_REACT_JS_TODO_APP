# To Do App

This React App was the first task of the React and Redux advanced course as part of the Full Stack Web Development Program at [Business College Helsinki](https://en.bc.fi/qualifications/full-stack-web-developer-program/).

The design is based off the Microsoft To Do app I have on my laptop.
